-- This query extracts the serum creatinine baselines of adult patients on each hospital admission.
-- The baseline is determined by the following rules:
--     i. if the lowest creatinine value during this admission is normal (<1.1), then use the value
--     ii. if the patient is diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD), then use the lowest creatinine value during the admission, although it may be rather large.
--     iii. Otherwise, we estimate the baseline using the Simplified MDRD Formula:
--          eGFR = 186 × Scr^(-1.154) × Age^(-0.203) × 0.742Female
--     Let eGFR = 75. Scr = [ 75 / 186 / Age^(-0.203) / (0.742Female) ] ^ (1/-1.154)
